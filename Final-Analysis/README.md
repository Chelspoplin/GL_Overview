## Conclusions & Key Insights

The uploaded screenshots illustrate one example scenario using the dashboard’s parameter controls. By adjusting Account Type, Department, and Breakout selections, the report allows users to move from a high-level financial view to targeted operational insights.

### 1. Margin Compression Driven by Rising Costs

In the example shown, costs rise steadily throughout the year while revenue softens in later months. This results in margin compression and increased volatility in monthly profit percentages.

If cost increases are ongoing (labor, materials, overhead), leadership may need to evaluate pricing strategy. Raising rates could help preserve margin and stabilize profitability.

### 2. Department-Level Cost Concentration

Breaking out GL amounts by **Department** reveals that Operations carries the highest total cost concentration.

This immediately highlights Operations as a key driver of expense and an area that warrants deeper review.

### 3. Marketing Spend Within Operations

After filtering specifically to the **Operations** department and switching the breakout to **GL Account**, the largest cost driver in this example is **Marketing Expense**.

At the same time, revenue does not show a corresponding increase in the screenshots provided. This suggests that marketing spend within Operations may not be generating sufficient return.

### 4. Strategic Recommendation (Example Scenario)

Based on the view demonstrated in the screenshots:

- Evaluate ROI on marketing spend within Operations.
- Consider reducing or pausing marketing investment in that department if it has not demonstrably increased revenue.
- Review pricing strategy to determine whether rate adjustments are necessary to offset rising costs.

### Final Takeaway

This example demonstrates the value of the dashboard’s parameter controls. By dynamically switching between Revenue vs. Cost, Department vs. GL Account, and applying targeted filters, users can move from high-level KPIs to specific cost drivers in just a few clicks.

The marketing expense within Operations is only one example insight shown in the uploaded screenshots. Many additional conclusions can be drawn depending on how the parameters are adjusted — including identifying underperforming departments, tracking margin shifts over time, isolating expense categories driving volatility, or evaluating revenue concentration.

The dashboard is designed to support exploratory financial analysis, enabling leadership to investigate trends, uncover root causes, and make informed strategic decisions.
